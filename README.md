## Granger Causality in Golang

`GrangerGo` is a project that implements Granger Causality test in golang. Its still a work in progress.

You can find python benchmark results in `python_benchmarks` directory. Refer to `tests` folder on details on how to use the package. I am still doing tests and verifying results. Once done this will be published and benchmarks compared with `statsmodels` implementation in python.
